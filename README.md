# Youtube Consistent Playlist Downloader

If you're like me who saves everything on their one and only playlist and have more or less downloaded the entire playlist (mp3 music) but that was a few months ago?
And your current state of the said playlist has 10 or 20 new entries? Well no fretting

## Prerequisites
Any kind of linux environment
yt-dlp (command line)
python3

## Usage
Configure your playlist, make sure it's not private and copy the playlist link, paste it onto the playlist variable string and set your directories and stuff.
```sh
python youtube.py
```
